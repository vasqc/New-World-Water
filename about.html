        Not all water is created equal.<br>

        How is that possible you may ask?<br>
        Well, there are different criteria that are considered in order to classify these different waters.
        <ul>
            <li>Source</li> 
            Where did the water actually come from?
            <li>TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)</li>
            What is actually in the water?<br>
            Different minerals, from naturally occuring sources, overtime make it into our favorite watering holes.<br>
            The outcome is the visua aspectl and most importantly, the overall taste. (And of course Nutrition)
            <li>Bubbles</li>
            Is it sparkiling? did a person put those bubbles in? or did mother earth?<br>
            "Well, I don't like my water with bubbles!"<br>
            Thats ok, there is STILL water available to you too. (but this is where it gets tricky, we'll talk about that much later.)

        </ul>
