# New-World-Water



Not all water is the same!

Water is the source of life, without water we cannot continue to survive.
But all water is not created equal!

Source is a major component, where they actually bottle the water is super important.  The source is so important, it dictates what nutrients that are available in the water.   Different minerals, such as Silica, Magnesium and Sodium are as important to your diet as Protein is (which is found in our food).   And of course being naturally occuring, is the best for your body.

How it is processed:   The "container", whether it be plastic, glass (the preferred method) or metal. How and where you store your water also adds to the nutrition of the element.

In this APP, we are giving different choices, at different price points for you to try out, by buying them, either direct or through a larger retailer such as Amazon.

Welcome to our group project about water.
