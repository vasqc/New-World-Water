# New-World-Water

Not all water is the same!

Water is the source of life, without water we cannot continue to survive.
But all water is not created equal!

In this APP, we are giving different choices, at different price points for you to try out, by buying them, either direct or through a larger retailer such as Amazon.

Welcome to our group project about water.

This is New World Water! Enjoy!
